            <p class="section-description">My name is Odisho Samano. I am a passionate and inquisitive software engineer with experience in numerous demanding backend environments. My specializations include languages such as Java, JavaScript, Angular, Python, C#, and frameworks like Spring and Express. I am also proficient in front-end languages like HTML, CSS, cloud work with AWS, linux and  software tools such as Visual studio code, Eclipse, Postman, Dbeaver, Mobaxterm. I consistently use these technologies, as evidenced by my job history. For more information, please take a look at my resume in the contact page or visit the Skills page below.</p>

            <p class="section-description">One of my greatest strengths is my passion for learning. I am always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends. Additionally, I am very consistent and dedicated, always aiming to complete my company and personal projects. Furthermore, I enjoy being creative and integrating my ideas into the tasks I undertake at work or within my personal software projects.</p>

            <p class="section-description">Outside of the software world, I enjoy many things including music—playing instruments, listening to music, and attending concerts. I also have a love for food and beverages, especially coffee!</p>

        <p class='section-description last_section'>

          Dunbar Consulting Inc. has been providing IT-related services to several government agencies, including the SEC. As a contractor for DCI, my contributions were tailored towards providing the necessary maintenance and operational task towards several SEC applications. These applications typically dealt with handling and processing incoming filings (forms 19b-4 and 19-7), internal user access or stock market analysis and reports. Most of these applications are housed within the SEC internal Network. Much of my contract period involved upgrading and maintaining the internal filing applications. Some of the work Included transitioning the application database from Sybase to PostgreSQL, upgrading the JBoss and WebLogic versions, front end changes to the webpages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular), addressing problem tickets (bugs that need to be resolved in the SEC application) in ServiceNow and addressing many of these issues by making changes in the backend java code. Finally, I’ve been involved with weekend work. This usually involves testing and maintenance of our applications during weekend patching.
